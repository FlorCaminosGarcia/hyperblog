    "You are assisting a product team designing an AI‑augmented study companion for university STEM students who struggle with translating theoretical concepts into procedural problem solving steps. Draft an instructive prompt that tells the model to: 1) ask the learner clarifying questions about the exact topic scope and constraints, 2) decompose the problem into labeled phases (Concept Recall, Strategy Selection, Worked Example, Variation Practice), 3) adapt explanations to the learner’s self‑reported confidence level, 4) insert brief metacognitive pauses that prompt reflection, and 5) conclude with a compact mastery checklist. Emphasize avoiding directly giving final answers until the learner attempts an intermediate step, encourage Socratic nudging over lecturing, and request output in a structured, markdown‑friendly format suitable for rendering inside an interactive panel.",
    "Compose a richly detailed scenario prompt for evaluating a large language model’s ability to perform multi‑turn requirements clarification in software engineering. The user initially provides a vague request: 'Build me a dashboard for sales insights.' Instruct the model to iteratively elicit missing details: target personas, primary metrics, data granularity, update frequency, permission layers, latency expectations, internationalization, color accessibility, and success criteria. The prompt should direct the model to surface implicit assumptions, batch related questions, summarize discovered facts at intervals, flag any contradictions, and end with a draft specification plus a risk register enumerating potential data quality, performance, and adoption pitfalls alongside mitigation ideas.",
    "Create a long‑form evaluation prompt that measures whether a model can translate a non‑technical founder’s narrative about a marketplace startup into a crisp investor one‑pager. Provide the founder’s informal description: scattered pain points, emotional anecdotes, and unsized opportunities. Instruct the model to extract: target segment definition, acute problem framing with current workaround cost, differentiating product capabilities, defensible advantages (network effects, data moats), business model, go‑to‑market wedge, traction proxies, key metrics to validate hypothesized value, and near‑term risks. Require a concise, investor‑friendly structure with prioritized bullet points, eliminating hype language while preserving authentic customer voice samples for credibility.",
    "Design a comprehensive system prompt for a code review assistant specializing in performance and reliability in distributed TypeScript microservices. The instructions should tell the model to: analyze diff context, highlight potential hidden latency (N+1 calls, serialization overhead), identify unsafe concurrency patterns, note missing input validation or idempotency safeguards, check observability (structured logs, trace spans, cardinality issues), assess resilience patterns (circuit breakers, retries with jitter), and suggest precise refactorings with complexity trade‑offs. Require responses to classify findings Severity (Blocker/Major/Minor/Informational), cite relevant diff hunks, and supply a concrete before/after snippet where feasible while avoiding speculative style nitpicks.",
    "Write a detailed narrative worldbuilding seed for a near‑future coastal city adapting to accelerating sea level rise through layered infrastructural, ecological, and socio‑economic innovations. Describe amphibious transit corridors, floating agro‑modules, dynamic insurance pricing tied to sensor verified mitigations, community data trusts governing environmental telemetry, and a civic digital twin mediating participatory zoning simulations. Introduce tensions: equity gaps in adaptive retrofits, emergent informal economies around salvage robotics, and ethical debates over predictive relocation algorithms. The prompt should invite expansion into plots about resilience, governance legitimacy, techno‑cultural identity, and collective memory of pre‑inundation neighborhoods.",
    "Formulate an advanced reasoning test prompt where the model is given interleaved fragments of a research abstract, partial definitions, and two misleading statistical claims. Instruct it to reconstruct the intended hypothesis, differentiate between correlation and causal inference cues, propose a minimal experimental design that would validate or falsify the core claim, and calculate (symbolically) how a confound would bias an observed effect size.

    "Construct a detailed creative writing prompt tasking the model to produce a dual‑voice short story where one narrative thread is a human urban forager documenting resilient edible species during infrastructural blackouts, while the parallel thread is an abandoned municipal sensing network gradually regaining partial functionality. Specify alternating sections, subtle lexical divergence signaling perspective, converging thematic motifs of adaptation, mutual inference, and rewilding. Instruct the model to avoid dystopian clichés, lean into quiet technical wonder, and end with an ambiguous collaborative act that reframes resource scarcity as pattern literacy.",
    "Author a nuanced prompt for generating an accessibility audit summary of a complex data visualization dashboard containing time series, heatmaps, and interactive drill‑downs. Direct the model to inspect (described) component metadata for color contrast ratios, focus order anomalies, ARIA role misuse, keyboard trap risks, and dynamic content announcements.

Requirements: identify cohesive service boundaries, enumerate database coupling hotspots, suggest a strangler migration sequence, outline contract testing introduction, propose incremental observability enhancements, and quantify potential deployment frequency uplift. Output should contain a dependency graph summary, a risk heat map, and a milestone table with measurable success indicators while explicitly flagging assumptions needing empirical validation.",
    "Craft a long context prompt for evaluating retrieval‑augmented generation quality. Provide a fictitious knowledge base excerpt with overlapping, partially conflicting statements about an open hardware specification evolution.
